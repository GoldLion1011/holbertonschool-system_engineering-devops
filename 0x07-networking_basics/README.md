### 0. OSI model
Questions:

What is the OSI model?

1.  Set of specifications that network hardware manufacturers must respect
2.  The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology
3.  The OSI model is a model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system with a strong regard for their underlying internal structure and technology

How is the OSI model organized?

1.  Alphabetically
2.  From the lowest to the highest level
3.  Randomly
### 1. Types of network
Questions:

2.  WAN
3.  LAN

What type of network could connect an office in one building to another office in a building a few streets away?

2.  WAN
3.  LAN

What network do you use when you browse www.google.com from your smartphone (not connected to the Wifi)?

1.  Internet
2.  WAN
3.  LAN
### 2. MAC and IP address
Questions:

What is a MAC address?

1.  The name of a network interface
2.  The unique identifier of a network interface
3.  A network interface

What is an IP address?

1.  Is to devices connected to a network what postal address is to houses
2.  The unique identifier of a network interface
3.  Is a number that network devices use to connect to networks
### 3. UDP and TCP
Questions:

-   Which statement is correct for the TCP box:
    1.  `It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely`
    2.  `It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process`
-   Which statement is correct for the UDP box:
    1.  `It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely`
    2.  `It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process`
-   Which statement is correct for the TCP worker:
    1.  `Have you received boxes x, y, z?`
    2.  `May I increase the rate at which I am sending you boxes?`
  ### 4. TCP and UDP ports
  Write a Bash script that displays listening ports:

-   That only shows listening sockets
-   That shows the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs
### 5. Is the host on the network
Write a Bash script that pings an IP address passed as an argument.

Requirements:

-   Accepts a string as an argument
-   Displays  `Usage: 5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS}`  if no argument passed
-   Ping the IP 5 times
