# 0x04. MySQL
In this project, I learned the roles of databases and replicas and the importance of running operations on them to ensure my backup strategy is effective.

## Tasks

### 0. Install MySQL
MySQL installed on **both** your web-01 and web-02 servers.
### 1. Let us in!
Create a user and password for **both** MySQL databases which will allow the checker access to them.
### 2. If only you could see what I've seen with your eyes
In order for you to set up replication, youâ€™ll need to have a database with at least one table and one row in your primary MySQL server (web-01) to replicate from.
### 3. Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it?
On your **primary** MySQL server (web-01), create a new user for the replica server.
### 4. Setup a Primary-Replica infrastructure using MySQL
### 5. MySQL backup
Write a Bash script that generates a MySQL dump and creates a compressed archive out of it.
